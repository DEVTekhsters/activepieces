# Progress Tracking

## Work Completed
- Initial project context analysis
- Memory Bank structure initialization
- Identified key requirements for offline Docker packaging
- Analyzed package.json for dependencies and build scripts
- Created and implemented core build scripts:
  - build-all-pieces.sh for parallel piece compilation
  - test-offline-build.sh for offline validation
- Updated Dockerfile with offline-first approach:
  - Added pieces-build stage
  - Implemented dependency caching
  - Configured offline npm installations
- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - Offline build process
  - Testing procedures
  - Troubleshooting guide
