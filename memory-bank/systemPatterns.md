# System Patterns

## Docker Build Patterns
1. Multi-stage Build Pattern
   - Use multi-stage builds to optimize final image size
   - Separate build dependencies from runtime dependencies
   - Cache layers effectively for faster builds

2. Dependency Management Pattern
   - Package all dependencies at build time
   - Avoid runtime network calls for package fetching
   - Version lock all community pieces

3. Community Piece Integration Pattern
   - Pre-build all community pieces during image creation
   - Bundle compiled pieces within the image
   - Implement local piece registry

## Architecture Patterns
1. Offline-First Pattern
   - All required assets bundled in container
   - No runtime dependency downloads
   - Local-first resource resolution

2. Resource Bundling Pattern
   - Static bundling of community pieces
   - Pre-compilation of dependencies
   - Deterministic build outputs

## Testing Patterns
1. Offline Validation Pattern
   - Test builds in network-isolated environments
   - Validate piece availability without network
   - Verify runtime independence

2. Integration Testing Pattern
   - Validate piece registration
   - Test piece execution in isolated mode
   - Verify resource availability

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Build Process
   - Use .dockerignore for build optimization
   - Implement proper layer caching
   - Maintain clear stage separation

2. Dependency Management
   - Lock all dependency versions
   - Document all community pieces
   - Maintain dependency manifest

3. Validation
   - Implement offline build tests
   - Verify piece availability
   - Test in restricted networks
